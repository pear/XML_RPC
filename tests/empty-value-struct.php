 * If the package version number is found in the left hand

 * come from the PEAR installer.  Therefore, let's test the
 * installed version of XML_RPC which should be in the include path.
 *
 * If the version has not been substituted in the if() expression,
 * this file has likely come from a SVN checkout or a .tar file.
 * Therefore, we'll assume the tests should use the version of
 * XML_RPC that has come from there as well.
